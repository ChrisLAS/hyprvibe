# Hyprland Configuration for Nixstation
# See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Configuring-Hyprland/

# Source shared base configuration (Hyprland doesn't expand ~)
source = /home/chrisf/.config/hypr/hyprland-base.conf

# Source host-specific monitor configuration
source = /home/chrisf/.config/hypr/hyprland-monitors-nixstation.conf

# Nixstation-specific overrides and additions can go here
# For example:
# - Machine-specific keybindings
# - Hardware-specific settings
# - Performance tweaks for 4-monitor setup

# Auto-mount R2 storage on login
exec-once = r2-mount

# Reaper window rules - DISABLED
# Temporarily removed due to Hyprland 0.53 syntax changes
# TODO: Re-add once correct windowrule syntax for 0.53 is confirmed
# These rules were for managing Reaper X11/XWayland window behavior
# (floating dialogs, sizing, focus management)
# Fix cursor visibility on rotated/transformed displays (vertical monitors)
# Required for Hyprland 0.53+ with transform,1 (90-degree rotation)
